0.6.2 (2020-08-06)
==================

Quick release enabling additional configuration file to use with CodePipeline


0.6.0 (2020-08-03)
===================

New features:
* `Docker-compose multi-files (override support) <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/121>`_

The new CLI uses positional arguments matching a specific command which drives what's executed onwards.
Trying to re-implement features as close to the docker-compose CLI as possible.

* **config** allows to get the YAML file render of the docker-compose files put together.
* **render** will put all input files together and generate the CFN templates accordingly.
* **up** will deploy do the same as render, and deploy to AWS CFN.


0.5.3 (2020-07-30)
==================

A lot of minor bug fixes and removing CLI commands to the benefit of better implementation via the compose file.

0.5.2 (2020-07-30)
==================

New features:

* `Support for AWS KMS <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/77>`_

The support for KMS will be extended to use the CMK for RDS/SQS/SNS and any resource that can use KMS for encryption
at rest.

.. hint:: Mind, this might occur a few extra costs.


0.5.1 (2020-07-28)
===================

Small bug patches and code refactoring.
SQS now into a single stack unless there are more than 30 queues.

0.5.0 (2020-07-27)
==================

New features
------------

* `DynamoDB support <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/31>`_
* Lookup for existing tables which the services get IAM access to.

0.4.0 (2020-07-20)
==================

* `ACM Support for ALB/NLB for public services. <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/93>`_
* `AWS AppMesh support <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/57>`_
* Attempt to making navigation through docs better.
* Automatic release to https://nightly.docs.ecs-composex.lambda-my-aws.io/ from master

To help with code quality and support, I subscribed to the following services:

* `CodeScanning using SonarCloud.io <https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=lambda-my-aws_ecs_composex>`_
* `CodeCoverage reports with Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex>`_


0.3.0 (2020-06-21)
==================

Refactored the way the services, task definitions and containers are put together, in order to support multiple new features:

* `Allow multiple services to be merged into one Task definition <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/78>`_
* `Support Docker compose v3 compute definition <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/32>`_

The support for Docker compose compute settings allows to add up all the CPU / RAM of your service(s) and identify the
closest Fargate CPU/RAM configuration for the **Task Definition** (the respective CPU/RAM of each task is unchanged).


The docker-compose file is now more strictly close to the definition set in Docker Compose, with regards to attributes
and their expected types.

.. note::

    In order to respect more closely the docker-compose definition, the key previously used **configs** now is **x-configs**

0.2.3 (2020-04-16)
==================

Refactored the ecs part into a class and reworked the configuration settings to allow for easier integration.
Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in the structure of the configs section.

New features
-------------

* Enable AWS X-Ray (`#56 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/56>`_)
    Enabling X-Ray will allow developer to get APM metrics and visualize the application interaction with other
    services.

* No-upload (`#64 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/64>`_)
    This allows to store the templates locally only.

    .. note::

        The templates are still validated from their body

* IAM Boundary for the IAM roles (`#55 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/55>`_)
    Permissions boundary are an IAM feature that allows to set boundaries which superseed other permissions associated
    to the entity. It is often the put as a condition for users creating roles to assign a specific Permission Boundary
    policy to the roles created.


0.2.2 (2020-04-10)
==================

Refactor of the ECS service template into a single class (still got to be reworked).
Refactored the ECS Services into a master class which ingests the CLI kwargs directly.

Reworked and reorganized documentation to help with readability

0.2.1 (2020-05-03)
==================

Code refactored to allow a better way to go over each template and stack so everything is treated in memory
before being put into a file and uploaded into S3.

* Issues closed
    * Docs update and first go at IAM perms (`#22`_)
    * Refactor of XModules logic onto ECS services (`#39`_)
    * Templates & Stacks refactor (`#38`_)
    * Update issue templates for easy PRs and Bug reports
    * Added `make conform` to run black against the code to standardize syntax (`#26`_)
    * Allow to specify directory to write all the templates to in addition to S3. (`#27`_)
    * Reformatted with black (`#25`_)
    * Expand TagsSpecifications with x-tags (`#24`_)
    * Bug fix for root template and Cluster reference (`#20`_)

Documentation structure and content updated to help navigate through modules in an easier way.
Documented syntax reference for each module

New features
-------------

* `#6`_ - Implement x-rds. Allows to create RDS databases with very little properties needed
    * Creates Aurora cluster and DB Instance
    * Creates the DB Parameter Group by importing default settings.
    * Creates a common subnet group for all DBs to run into (goes to Storage subnets when using --create-vpc).
    * Creates DB username and password in AWS SecretsManager
    * Applies IAM permissions to ECS Execution Role to get access to the secret
    * Applies ECS Container Secrets to the containers to provide them with the secret values through Environment variables.


0.1.3 (2020-04-13)
==================

A patch release with a lot of little features added driven by the writing up of the blog to make it easier to have in
a CICD pipeline.

See overall progress on `GH Project`_

Issues closed
--------------

* `Issue 14 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/14>`_
* `Issue 15 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/15>`_


0.1.2 (2020-04-04)
==================

Patch release aiming to improve the CLI and integration of the Compute layer so that the compute resources creation
in EC2 are standalone and can be created separately if one so wished to reuse.

Issues closed
-------------

 `Issue <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/7>`_ related to the fix.

0.1.1 (2020-04-02)
==================

Added tags definition from Docker ComposeX with the x-tags which allows to add tags
to all resources that support tagging from AWS CFN

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-tags:
      - name: TagA
        value: SomeValue
      - name: CostcCentre
        value: IamNotPayingForThis
      - name: Some:Special:Key
        value: A long weird value

or alternatively in an object/dict format

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-tags:
      TagA: ValueA
      TagB: ValueB

0.1.0 (2020-03-24)
