* `Support for Service logs expiry from compose definition <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/165>`_
* `Enable to use AWS CFN native PseudoParameters in string values <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/182>`_
* `Improved Environment variables interpolation to follow the docker-compose behaviour <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/185>`_


Closed reported issues:
------------------------
* https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/175

Some code refactor and bug fixes have gone in as well to improve stability and addition of new services.


0.7.0 (2020-08-12)
===================

New features:

* `Support for AWS Secrets mapping to secrets in docker-compose <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/pull/142>`_
* Support for `Use` on VPC which needs no lookup
* Support for IAM policies to manually add ad-hoc permissions outside of the pre-defined ones
* Additional configuration file to use with CodePipeline

Various bug fixes and some small features to help making plug-and-play easier.
Introduction to `Use` which should allow for resources reference outside of your account
without cross-account lookup.


0.6.0 (2020-08-03)
===================

New features:
* `Docker-compose multi-files (override support) <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/121>`_

The new CLI uses positional arguments matching a specific command which drives what's executed onwards.
Trying to re-implement features as close to the docker-compose CLI as possible.

* **config** allows to get the YAML file render of the docker-compose files put together.
* **render** will put all input files together and generate the CFN templates accordingly.
* **up** will deploy do the same as render, and deploy to AWS CFN.


0.5.3 (2020-07-30)
==================

A lot of minor bug fixes and removing CLI commands to the benefit of better implementation via the compose file.

0.5.2 (2020-07-30)
==================

New features:

* `Support for AWS KMS <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/77>`_

The support for KMS will be extended to use the CMK for RDS/SQS/SNS and any resource that can use KMS for encryption
at rest.

.. hint:: Mind, this might occur a few extra costs.


0.5.1 (2020-07-28)
===================

Small bug patches and code refactoring.
SQS now into a single stack unless there are more than 30 queues.

0.5.0 (2020-07-27)
==================

New features
------------

* `DynOAamoDB support <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/31>`_
* Lookup for existing tables which the services get IAM access to.

0.4.0 (2020-07-20)
==================

* `ACM Support for ALB/NLB for public services. <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/93>`_
* `AWS AppMesh support <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/57>`_
* Attempt to making navigation through docs better.
* Automatic release to https://nightly.docs.ecs-composex.lambda-my-aws.io/ from master

To help with code quality and support, I subscribed to the following services:

* `CodeScanning using SonarCloud.io <https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=lambda-my-aws_ecs_composex>`_
* `CodeCoverage reports with Codecov <https://codecov.io/gh/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex>`_


0.3.0 (2020-06-21)
==================

Refactored the way the services, task definitions and containers are put together, in order to support multiple new features:

* `Allow multiple services to be merged into one Task definition <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/78>`_
* `Support Docker compose v3 compute definition <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/32>`_

The support for Docker compose compute settings allows to add up all the CPU / RAM of your service(s) and identify the
closest Fargate CPU/RAM configuration for the **Task Definition** (the respective CPU/RAM of each task is unchanged).


The docker-compose file is now more strictly close to the definition set in Docker Compose, with regards to attributes
and their expected types.

.. note::

    In order to respect more closely the docker-compose definition, the key previously used **configs** now is **x-configs**

0.2.3 (2020-04-16)
==================

Refactored the ecs part into a class and reworked the configuration settings to allow for easier integration.
Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in the structure of the configs section.

New features
-------------

* Enable AWS X-Ray (`#56 <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/56>`_)
    Enabling X-Ray will allow developer to get APM metrics and visualize the application interaction with other
    services.

* No-upload (`#64 <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/64>`_)
    This allows to store the templates locally only.

    .. note::

        The templates are still validated from their body

* IAM Boundary for the IAM roles (`#55 <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/55>`_)
    Permissions boundary are an IAM feature that allows to set boundaries which superseed other permissions associated
    to the entity. It is often the put as a condition for users creating roles to assign a specific Permission Boundary
    policy to the roles created.


0.2.2 (2020-04-10)
==================

Refactor of the ECS service template into a single class (still got to be reworked).
Refactored the ECS Services into a master class which ingests the CLI kwargs directly.

Reworked and reorganized documentation to help with readability

0.2.1 (2020-05-03)
==================

Code refactored to allow a better way to go over each template and stack so everything is treated in memory
before being put into a file and uploaded into S3.

* Issues closed
    * Docs update and first go at IAM perms (`#22`_)
    * Refactor of XModules logic onto ECS services (`#39`_)
    * Templates & Stacks refactor (`#38`_)
    * Update issue templates for easy PRs and Bug reports
    * Added `make conform` to run black against the code to standardize syntax (`#26`_)
    * Allow to specify directory to write all the templates to in addition to S3. (`#27`_)
    * Reformatted with black (`#25`_)
    * Expand TagsSpecifications with x-tags (`#24`_)
    * Bug fix for root template and Cluster reference (`#20`_)

Documentation structure and content updated to help navigate through modules in an easier way.
Documented syntax reference for each module

New features
-------------

* `#6`_ - Implement x-rds. Allows to create RDS databases with very little properties needed
    * Creates Aurora cluster and DB Instance
    * Creates the DB Parameter Group by importing default settings.
    * Creates a common subnet group for all DBs to run into (goes to Storage subnets when using --create-vpc).
    * Creates DB username and password in AWS SecretsManager
    * Applies IAM permissions to ECS Execution Role to get access to the secret
    * Applies ECS Container Secrets to the containers to provide them with the secret values through Environment variables.


0.1.3 (2020-04-13)
==================

A patch release with a lot of little features added driven by the writing up of the blog to make it easier to have in
a CICD pipeline.

See overall progress on `GH Project`_

Issues closed
--------------

* `Issue 14 <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/14>`_
* `Issue 15 <https://github.com/compose-x/ecs_composex/issues/15>`_


0.1.2 (2020-04-04)
==================

in EC2 are standalone and can be created separately if one so wished to reuse.

to all resources that support tagging from AWS CFN

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-tags:
      - name: TagA
        value: SomeValue
      - name: CostcCentre
        value: IamNotPayingForThis
      - name: Some:Special:Key
        value: A long weird value

or alternatively in an object/dict format

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-tags:
      TagA: ValueA
      TagB: ValueB

0.1.0 (2020-03-24)
==================

* First release on PyPI.
    * Working VPC + Cluster + Services
    * Working expansion of existing Cluster with new VPC
    * Working expansion of existing VPC and Cluster with new services
    * IAM working to allow services access to SQS queues
