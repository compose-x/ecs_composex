0.2.3 (2020-04-16)
==================

Refactored the ecs part into a class and reworked the configuration settings to allow for easier integration.
Documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in the structure of the configs section.

New features
-------------

* Enable AWS X-Ray (`#56 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/56>`_)
    Enabling X-Ray will allow developer to get APM metrics and visualize the application interaction with other
    services.

* No-upload (`#64 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/64>`_)
    This allows to store the templates locally only.

    .. note::

        The templates are still validated from their body

* IAM Boundary for the IAM roles (`#55 <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/55>`_)
    Permissions boundary are an IAM feature that allows to set boundaries which superseed other permissions associated
    to the entity. It is often the put as a condition for users creating roles to assign a specific Permission Boundary
    policy to the roles created.


0.2.2 (2020-04-10)
==================

Refactor of the ECS service template into a single class (still got to be reworked).
Refactored the ECS Services into a master class which ingests the CLI kwargs directly.

Reworked and reorganized documentation to help with readability

0.2.1 (2020-05-03)
==================

Code refactored to allow a better way to go over each template and stack so everything is treated in memory
before being put into a file and uploaded into S3.

* Issues closed
    * Docs update and first go at IAM perms (`#22`_)
    * Refactor of XModules logic onto ECS services (`#39`_)
    * Templates & Stacks refactor (`#38`_)
    * Update issue templates for easy PRs and Bug reports
    * Added `make conform` to run black against the code to standardize syntax (`#26`_)
    * Allow to specify directory to write all the templates to in addition to S3. (`#27`_)
    * Reformatted with black (`#25`_)
    * Expand TagsSpecifications with x-tags (`#24`_)
    * Bug fix for root template and Cluster reference (`#20`_)

Documentation structure and content updated to help navigate through modules in an easier way.
Documented syntax reference for each module

New features
-------------

* `#6`_ - Implement x-rds. Allows to create RDS databases with very little properties needed
    * Creates Aurora cluster and DB Instance
    * Creates the DB Parameter Group by importing default settings.
    * Creates a common subnet group for all DBs to run into (goes to Storage subnets when using --create-vpc).
    * Creates DB username and password in AWS SecretsManager
    * Applies IAM permissions to ECS Execution Role to get access to the secret
    * Applies ECS Container Secrets to the containers to provide them with the secret values through Environment variables.


0.1.3 (2020-04-13)
==================

A patch release with a lot of little features added driven by the writing up of the blog to make it easier to have in
a CICD pipeline.

0.1.2 (2020-04-04)
==================

Patch release aiming to improve the CLI and integration of the Compute layer so that the compute resources creation
