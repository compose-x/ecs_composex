Installation
============

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ecs_composex

Usage
=====

.. code-block:: bash

    usage: ecs-composex [-h] -n NAME -f DOCKERCOMPOSEXFILE [-d OUTPUTDIRECTORY]
                        [--format {json,yaml,text}] [--region REGIONNAME]
                        [--az ZONES] [-b BUCKETNAME] [--use-spot-fleet]
                        {up,config,version} ...

    positional arguments:
      {up,config,version}   Command to execute.
        up                  Generates & Validates the CFN templates,
                            Creates/Updates stack in CFN
        config              Generates & Validates the CFN templates locally. No
                            upload to S3.
        version             ECS ComposeX Version

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -n NAME, --name NAME  Name of your stack
      -f DOCKERCOMPOSEXFILE, --docker-compose-file DOCKERCOMPOSEXFILE
                            Path to the Docker compose file
      -d OUTPUTDIRECTORY, --output-dir OUTPUTDIRECTORY
                            Output directory to write all the templates to.
      --format {json,yaml,text}
                            Defines the format you want to use.
      --region REGIONNAME   Specify the region you want to build fordefault use
                            default region from config or environment vars
      --az ZONES            List AZs you want to deploy to specifically within the
                            region
      -b BUCKETNAME, --bucket-name BUCKETNAME
                            Bucket name to upload the templates to
      --use-spot-fleet      Runs spotfleet for EC2. If used in combination of
                            --use-fargate, it will create an additional SpotFleet

.. note::

    Each component can also use the docker-compose file but be deployed on its own, allowing, for production workloads,
    to deploy each component separately to avoid dependencies on each other.

AWS Resources support
=====================

* `AWS ECS`_: from docker-compose to ECS transparently, using AWS Fargate primarily.
* `AWS VPC`_: create or use existing VPC to deploy your services
* `AWS AppMesh`_: Services mesh for your services.
* `AWS SQS`_: queues for distributed workloads
* `AWS RDS`_: databases integration made easy
* `AWS EC2`_: Deploy your services on EC2 for custom settings. Features SpotFleet by default.
* `AWS KMS`_: Manage CMK for your deployments
* AWS SNS



Documentation
=============

.. tip::

    `Nightly documentation <https://nightly.docs.ecs-composex.lambda-my-aws.io/>`_ following the master branch.

Follow the news and technical articles on using ECS ComposeX on the `Blog`_

* `CICD Pipeline for multiple services on AWS ECS with ECS ComposeX`_

.. tip::

    If you do not need extra AWS resources such as SQS queues to be created as part of these microservices deployments,
    I would recommend to use `AWS ECS CLI`_ which does already a lot of the work for the services.
    Alternatively, use the AWS CLI v2. It is absolutely smashing-ly awesome and might be just what you need
    This tool aims to reproduce the original ECS CLI behaviour whilst adding logic for non ECS resources that you want
    to create in your environment.
