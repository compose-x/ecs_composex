Properties
===========

For the properties, go to to `AWS CFN S3 Definition`_

Settings
=========

Some use-cases require special adjustments. This is what this section is for.

* `ExpandRegionToBucket`_
* `ExpandAccountIdToBucket`_
* `EnableEncryption`_

ExpandRegionToBucket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When definining the `BucketName` in properties, if wanted to, for uniqueness or readability, you can append to that string
the region id (which is DNS compliant) to the bucket name.

.. code-block:: yaml

    Properties:
      BucketName: abcd-01
    Settings:
      ExpandRegionToBucket: True

Results into

.. code-block:: yaml

    !Sub abcd-01-${AWS::Region}

ExpandAccountIdToBucket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to ExpandRegionToBucket, it will append the account ID (additional or instead of).

.. code-block:: yaml

    Properties:
      BucketName: abcd-01
    Settings:
      ExpandRegionToBucket: True

Results into

.. code-block:: yaml

    !Sub 'abcd-01-${AWS::AccountId}'

.. hint::

    If you set both ExpandAccountIdToBucket and ExpandRegionToBucket, you end up with

    .. code-block:: yaml

        !Sub 'abcd-01-${AWS::Region}-${AWS::AccountId}'

NameSeparator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As shown above, the separator between the bucket name and AWS::AccountId or AWS::Region is **-**. This parameter allows
you to define something else.

.. note::

    I would recommend not more than 2 characters separator.

.. warning::

    The separator must allow for DNS compliance **[a-z0-9.-]**


EnableEncryption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set to True (default) it will automatically define bucket encryption using AES256.

.. hint::

    Soon will link x-kms keys definition to that to allow you to re-use existing keys.

Services
========

As for all other resource types, you can define the type of access you want based to the S3 buckets.
However, for buckets, this means distinguish the bucket and the objects resource.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: permissions example

    x-s3:
      bucketA:
        Properties: {}
        Settings: {}
        Services:
          - name: service-01
            access:
              objects: RW
              bucket: ListOnly

.. hint::

    Refer to :ref:`s3_access_types_reference` to review available permissions

Lookup
=======

Lookup is currently implemented for S3 buckets!

.. hint::

    For S3, if the S3 bucket has a default KMS key encryption, the services will automatically be granted KMS default
    **EncryptDecrypt** permissions in order to allow using the KMS key for objects manipulation.
