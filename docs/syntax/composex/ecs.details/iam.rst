This section is the entrypoint to further extension of IAM definition for the IAM roles created throughout.

boundary
""""""""

This key represents an IAM policy (name or ARN) that needs to be added to the IAM roles in order to represent the IAM
Permissions Boundary.

.. note::

    You can either provide a full policy arn, or just the name of your policy.
    The validation regexp is:

    .. code-block:: python

        r"((^([a-zA-Z0-9-_.\/]+)$)|(^(arn:aws:iam::(aws|[0-9]{12}):policy\/)[a-zA-Z0-9-_.\/]+$))"

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

    services:
      serviceA:
        image: nginx
        x-configs:
          iam:
            boundary: containers
      serviceB:
        image: redis
        x-configs:
          iam:
            boundary: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/PowerUserAccess

.. note::

    if you specify ony the name, ie. containers, this will resolve into arn:${partition}:iam::${accountId}:policy/containers

policies
"""""""""

Allows you to define additional IAM policies.
Follows the same pattern as CFN IAM Policies

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-configs:
      iam:
        policies:
          - name: somenewpolicy
            document:
              Version: "2012-10-17"
              Statement:
                - Effect: Allow
                  Action:
                    - ec2:Describe*
                  Resource:
                    - "*"
                  Sid: "AllowDescribeAll"

managed_policies
""""""""""""""""

Allows you to add additional managed policies. You can specify the full ARN or just a string for the name / path of the
policy. If will resolve into the same regexp as for `boundary`_


xray
^^^^^
This section allows to enable X-Ray to run right next to your container.
It will use the AWS original image for X-Ray Daemon and exposes the ports to the task.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-configs:
      composex:
        xray:
          enabled: true

    services:
      serviceA:
        x-configs:
          xray:
            enabled: True
