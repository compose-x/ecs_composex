Syntax
=======

.. code-block:: yaml

    x-kms:
      keyA:
        Properties: {}
        Settings: {}
        Services: []
        Lookup: {}

Properties
==========

See `AWS CFN KMS Key Documentation`_

Settings
========


Alias
------

In addition to EnvNames, for KMS, we also have **Alias** which will create an Alias along with the KMS Key.
The alias name must be a string, not starting with alias/aws or aws. If you specify a an alias starting with **alias/**
then the string will be used as is, if you only specify a short name, then the alias will be prefixed with the RootStack
name and region.
