This section allows you to define how you would like the ECS Cluster to be configured.
It also allows you to define `Lookup` to use an existing ECS Cluster.

Lookup
======
Allows you to enter the name of an existing ECS Cluster that you want to deploy your services to.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Lookup existing cluster example.

    x-cluster:
      Lookup:
        Tags:
          - name: clusterabcd
          - costcentre: lambda


.. warning::

    If the cluster name is not found, by default, a new cluster will be created with the default settings.

Use
===

This key allows you to set a cluster to use, that you do not wish to lookup, you just know the name you want to use.
(Useful for multi-account where you can't lookup cross-account).
