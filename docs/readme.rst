Why use ECS ComposeX ?
======================

ECS ComposeX (or ComposeX for friends) first came out in early March, with some very basic features
and has grown over the past few months to add more and more features.

Since then, AWS released Copilot and has announced working with Docker to implement similar capabilities to allow
developers to have a better experience at developing as they would normally do and deploying to ECS.

However, I found that the feature set still remains somewhat limited, and as a Cloud Engineer working daily with developers,
I constantly have to balance features for developers and best practice in using AWS.

And at this point in time, neither of the previous tools are mentioned allow to do what ECS ComposeX do:

* Retain full docker-compose format specification compatibility without introducing
  a new format (Copilot has its own Environment file format)
* Provide support for more AWS services, such as RDS, DynamoDB, SQS etc.,
  which is not something supported in the Docker ecs-plugin or desktop app.


Trying to implement DevOps starting with developers
----------------------------------------------------

Whilst this is something that can be used by AWS Cloud Engineers tomorrow to deploy applications on ECS on the behalf
of their developers, the purpose of ECS ComposeX is to enable developers with a simplistic and familiar syntax that
takes away the need to be an AWS Expert. If tomorrow developers using ComposeX feel comfortable to deploy services
by themselves, I would be able to stop hand-holding them all the time and focus on other areas.


Philosphy
==========

CloudFormation is awesome, the documentation is excellent and the format easy. So ECS ComposeX wants to keep the format
of resources Properties as close to the orignal as possible as well as making it easier as well, just alike resources
like **AWS::Serverless::Function** which will create all the resources around your Lambda Function as well as the function.

Community focused
------------------

Any new Feature Request submitted by someone other than myself will get their request prioritized to try address their
use-cases as quickly as possible.

`Submit your Feature Request here <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/new/choose>`_

Ensure things work
------------------

It takes an insane amount of time to test everything as, generating CFN templates is easy, testing that everything
works end-to-end is a completely different thing.

I will always do my best to ensure that any new feature is tested end-to-end, but shall anything slip through the cracks,
please feel free to report your errors `here <https://github.com/lambda-my-aws/ecs_composex/issues/new/choose>`_


Modularity or "Plug & Play"
---------------------------

The majority of people who are going to use ECS ComposeX on a daily basis should be developers who need to have an
environment of their own and want to quickly iterate over it. However, it is certainly something that Cloud Engineers
in charge of the AWS accounts etc. would want to use to make their own lives easy too.

In many areas, you as the end-user of ComposeX will already have infrastructure in place: VPC, DBs and what not.
So as much as possible, you will be able in ComposeX to define :ref:`lookup_syntax_reference` sections which will find your existing resources,
and map these to the services.

Fargate First
-------------

However the original deployments and work on this project was done using EC2 instances (using SpotFleet), everything
is now implemented to work on AWS Fargate First (2020-06-06).

.. note::

    | :ref:`vpc_network_design`
    | :ref:`vpc_syntax_reference`
    | :ref:`ec2_compute_design`
    | :ref:`syntax_reference`

.. note::

    If you do not need extra AWS resources such as SQS queues to be created as part of these microservices deployments, I would recommend to use `AWS ECS CLI`_ which does already a lot of the work for the services.
    Alternatively, use the AWS CLI v2. It is absolutely smashing-ly awesome and might be just what you need
    This tool aims to reproduce the original ECS CLI behaviour whilst adding logic for non ECS resources that you want to create in your environment.
